#Select Data Access and Add or remove scopes
    #Search for the following scopes and add them, then save:
    #https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file 
    #https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets 
    #https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly 
    #https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly 
    #https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive
#Select Audience and under Testing, click Publish app
#In a browser (where you're signed into your gmail account), paste the following URL but replace the client_id
    #   https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?client_id=YOUR CLIENT ID HERE&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000&scope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive&response_type=code&include_granted_scopes=true&access_type=offline&state=state_parameter_passthrough_value
#Go through the consent screen (you will likely have to click advanced and "Go to NAME OF YOUR APP (unsafe)")
#Agree to the scope, which requests to make changes on your behalf; when you finally see the local host page, copy the url.  it will look something like this:
    #   http://localhost:3000/?state=state_parameter_passthrough_value&code=YOUR CODE&scope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive
#retrieve the returned code from the URL, which we will use in the call below:
code="INSERT YOUR CODE HERE"

#this is the call that will provide you with an access token as well as a refresh token, which you can use to make subsequent requests for new access tokens.
refreshCodeResponse=$( curl "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token" -s --request POST --data "code=$code&client_id=$clientId&client_secret=$clientSecret&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000&grant_type=authorization_code" )

echo $refreshCodeResponse

#within this json response, you will see the refresh_token value.  
#now you have the three elements (clientID, clientSecret, and refreshToken) that will allow you to always get a refreshed access token and send mail via zsh or bash script
